# Word2VecEmbeddings

This interactive project leverages advanced NLP techniques—Word2Vec and t‑SNE—to visualize and explore word embeddings trained on the Reuters corpus. It also features an interactive document retrieval system using cosine similarity between averaged word embeddings.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project was developed for the **DSAI4201 Selected Topics in Data Science** course taught by **[Dr. Uzair Ahmad](https://github.com/DrUzair)**. The goal was to create a robust tool for exploring NLP concepts through interactive visualizations and document retrieval. _AI tools were used to enhance the quality of the solution._
